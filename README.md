# misecreto

"misecreto" is a MERN fullstack project, users can share secrets anonymously, they can like and comment on them.

Secrets also have a like counter, which is restricted to 1 like via localstorage.

There are filters, to sort the secrets by "most recent", "most popular" and "most commented".

Mobile and desktop view available.

I hope to add more features in the future, such as the light/dark theme, login for the administrator user and some tools to analyze the secrets.
